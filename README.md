# Big Data Project

In this project I developed a music classifier using an existing Kaggle dataset found in the file *Link_To_Dataset.txt*.


For this matter I used the songs found as *.wav* files and I extracted the features that I wanted using the file *create_csv_2*. Data extracted is found in the *features* folder.


In the *main_2models* file I used the data contained in the newly created *.csv* file, then trained and tested on 2 different models: RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostTrees. I compared the results in the *.pdf* file attached.


I also performed a train and test on a DeepLearning method, Keras Sequential, in the *dl_method* file, with the results compared with the previous in the same PDF.
